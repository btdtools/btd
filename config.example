# BTD Example config file
#
# Config file is looked for at the following locations in order of priority:
# - The location specified with the -c flag
# - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btd/config
# - ~/.config/btd/config
# - /etc/btd.conf
# - $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/btd/config
# - /etc/xdg/btd/config
#
# Comments start with a # and can be inline
# All options are initialized with their defaults

# Location of the socket used for communicating with the daemon
#socket = btd.socket
#socket = ./the/path/of/this/socket/is/a/longer/than/one/hundred/and/eight/character/socket/so/this/will/throw/an/error/btd.socket
# ipv6 is also allowed
#socket = [::1]:1234
# ipv4 is also allowed
socket = 127.0.0.1:1234
# wildcards too, but they are buggy
#socket = *:1234

# Location of the database storing all the files
db = ./btddb # some comment

# Attached file storage
files = ./files

# Format in which to store files.

# %ext    - File extension
# %%      - literal % (why would you want this?)
#
# If an entry is not available an empty string is used.
filefmt = %year/%author - %title.%ext

# Path separator for files in internal database
pathsep = /

# Flag to check wether the bibtex snippets have the complete specs
